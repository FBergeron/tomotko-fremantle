        Here is a short and straight-forward guide to get
        started quickly with toMOTko.  
        </p><p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set the study languages</li>
            <li>Import existing glossaries</li>
            <li>Create your own glossaries</li>

        <h2>Set the study languages</h2>
        <p>
        By default, toMOTko's study language are English and Japanese.  If you want to learn
        different or additional languages, you must specify them in the Preferences like this:

            <li>A list of languages will appear where you can check (or uncheck) languages of interest.  
            You must choose at least 2 languages, including your mother tongue.  For example, if you're
            French and want to learn Russian and Chinese, you would check French, Russian, and Chinese languages.</li>
            <li>Click <tt>Ok</tt> to apply the changes.</li>

            Glossary Manager. 
            The first one must contain your mother language (or source language) and 
            the second one must contain the language you want to learn (or target language).
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Import existing glossaries</h2>
        <p>
        There are some glossaries already available on toMOTko's website in
        the Glossaries section.  If you see something that fits your needs there,
        download the glossary files into your computer.  Do not unzip those files.

            The very first time you use toMOTko, you will have only one folder
            named <tt>My Glossaries</tt>.</li>
            <li>Click the <tt>Import Data</tt> item in the application menu.</li>
            <li>Locate a downloaded glossary file and select it.</li>
        </ol>

        If none of the available glossaries interest you.  You can create your own glossaries like this:
        </p><p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Red Book button (middle of the left side of the Glossary Manager) to add a new and empty glossary.</li>

            <li>Repeat as needed.<li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Set up and start a quiz</h2>
        <p>
        To set up a quiz, you must specify which words the quiz will ask.
        To do that:
        </p><p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check all the words you want</li>
            <li>Check also the parent glossaries</li>
            <li>Check also the parent folders, if any.</li>
            <li>To start the quiz, click the <tt>Start Quiz</tt> item in the application menu.</li>
            <li>To gradually reveal information of the word being asked, click the Eye button as many times as needed.</li>
            <li>To signify a right answer, so that toMOTko stops asking the word, click the Green Circle button.
            To signify a wrong answer, so that toMOTko keeps asking the word, click the Red X button.
            By default, a word is repeated at least 2 times.  You can increase or decrease this value in the Preferences.</li>
