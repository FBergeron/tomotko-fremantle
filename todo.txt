ToDo (This is specific to maemo version.  For general todo, check in zaurus or qt4 branches)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Verify if KeyActionListViewItem is still needed.
Renable language filter?  If not, remove the accelerator and its mention in the help.
Make PreferencesDialog work.
    I have hidden the scrollbar of bodyWrapper.  Not sure if it's a good idea.  What's the standard way to do that on Maemo?
    The Reset Buttons for fonts do not work on Xephyr.  The problem is that the default font is not available (not installed?).
        Maybe we need to identify the best font and hardcode it for fremantle.
    Validate data before accepting them.
Reenable Cut/Copy/Paste in TermDialog?
Rewrite online help and renew screenshots.
Review all code and check for comments.
Review all strings in all languages.
